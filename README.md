# Theory

1. Arithmetic Operators

Used for basic mathematical operations.

    + : Addition

    - : Subtraction

    * : Multiplication

    / : Division

    % : Modulus (remainder)

Example: a + b, x % y

2. Relational (Comparison) Operators

Used to compare values and return a Boolean (true or false).

    == : Equal to

    != : Not equal to

    > : Greater than

    < : Less than

    >= : Greater than or equal to

    <= : Less than or equal to

Example: a != b, x >= y
3. Logical Operators

Used to combine or invert Boolean expressions.

    && : Logical AND (true if both are true)

    || : Logical OR (true if at least one is true)

    ! : Logical NOT (inverts true/false)

Example: (a > b) && (b < c)
4. Assignment Operators

Used to assign values to variables.

    = : Simple assignment

    += : Add and assign

    -= : Subtract and assign

    *= : Multiply and assign

    /= : Divide and assign

    %= : Modulus and assign

Example: x += 5 is the same as x = x + 5

5. Increment and Decrement Operators

Used to increase or decrease a variableâ€™s value by 1.

    ++ : Increment

    -- : Decrement

    Can be prefix (++x) or postfix (x++)

Example: i++, --count
